# Numlock_Toggler
 
This is a simple C++ program that simulates a single key press of the <kbd>NUMLOCK</kbd> key. It can be useful if you're running into a Windows issue where you'd want your <kbd>NUMLOCK</kbd> key to be on when you boot log in, but for some reason it is always off. You can do this by simply adding this little program to run once on startup.
